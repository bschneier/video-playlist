## Video Playlist

This is a progressive web application that plays a static list of video clips. It supports video files hosted locally on the app server or externally, including any YouTube video. This application is written in Angular and uses [Video.js](https://videojs.com) for video playback. In the future this application will be modified to pull videos from a back-end service/database and allow users to create an account, their own playlist(s) and collaborative playlists with other users.

A live instance of this application is running [here](https://videoplaylist.brianschneier.net).

To run this application locally, clone this repository and run the following commands:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
